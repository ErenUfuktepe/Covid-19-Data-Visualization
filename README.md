# Covid-19-Data-Visualization

### Introduction 

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.According to WHO, Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

This virus started in late 2019 and it spread all around the world really fast. Each country tried to control the spread in different ways but most of them were not successful and we can see that new cases are increasing dramatically day by day but who is in danger?

The first confirmed case of the virus in the United States was discovered on January 21, 2020, six months ago. The infected individual was a man in his 30s from Washington state. On March 17, 2020, confirmed cases of the virus had been reported in every state. Right now, the United States has the most deaths and cases around the world, and these numbers are increasing each day. According to WHO, older people, and those with underlying medical problems such as cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory disease are more likely to develop serious illnesses.

In this repository, I want to create some visuals using different datasets and show covid deaths and cases in the world and in the United States.
